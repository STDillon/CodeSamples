# CodeSamples
Samples of code for job applications and college.
Unfortunately most code written before late October 2019 was lost.
This repository will be updated with any code I see as substantial

NOTE: Some code may be incomplete as newer iterations may have been lost

NOTE: Sentiment analysis meant to be done on student comments is incomplete due to abandoning it since the scope of the project changed.
Howver I believe it to still have useful examples of my ability to perform sentiment analysis in the portions which were finished.
